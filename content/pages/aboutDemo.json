    "body": "This environment has been developed for Rijkswaterstaat\n (part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management) to facilitate discussions and raise awareness about leveraging data to address societal challenges. It explores topics such as data accessibility, pricing, secure collaboration with third parties, and the role of Gaia-X in cross-border data sharing.\n\nObjectives:\n- Implement an open-source, practical example of future-proof data sharing\n- Explore cross-border data exchange and Gaia-X concepts\n- Compare Gaia-X implementations with other initiatives to foster collaboration\n- Provide a base infrastructure for hackathons, proofs-of-concept, and partnerships \n\nWe are already publishing data and compute-to-data solutions on Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight drone pilots and proof-of-concepts via the ODL Pontus-X node, conducted in the Rotterdam Harbour Area. In 2025, we plan to expand these use cases to drone pilots and proof-of-concepts on the North Sea, as depicted on the map. These efforts are relevant to many public and private organizations across the Netherlands and beyond. In future phases, interested parties can join this initiative by adding datasets or algorithms to the marketplace."
