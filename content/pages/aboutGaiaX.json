Gaia-X focusses on the implementation of a decentralized, federated cloud- and data sharing infrastructure. Both public and private, cross-border. Non-European parties can participate but the rules are set based on the EU values: Openness, Fairness, Privacy, Security and Transparency.",

On the basis of technical specifications, services based on open-source code are being developed. They will then be developed into operational services and continuously improved by the Gaia-X Community.  These services are available for everyone who whishes to use them for their own implementations.",
